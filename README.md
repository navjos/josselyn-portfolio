# Josselyn Navas' Personal Website
Hi there! Thanks for coming. 

This is a working draft of my personal website. This website will house my portfolio of projects (life, coding, and otherwise!). 
My aim is for it to be a clean, minimalist website. 

You can visit my live website here:  https://navjos.github.io/josselyn-portfolio/
